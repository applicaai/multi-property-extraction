    abstract  = "This paper investigates various Transformer architectures on the WikiReading
Information Extraction and Machine Reading Comprehension dataset. The proposed
dual-source model outperforms the current state-of-the-art by a large margin.
Next, we introduce WikiReading Recycled-a newly developed public dataset and
the task of multiple property extraction. It uses the same data as WikiReading
but does not inherit its predecessor's identified disadvantages. In addition,
we provide a human-annotated test set with diagnostic subsets for a detailed
analysis of model performance.",
